### Statistics 588 Project

This was the final project for Statistics 588 at Rutgers. The course title was "Data Mining and Machine Learning" in the Fall of 2018
and was taught by Professor Min Xu. In this project, I performed a review of the Knockoff procedure proposed by Barber and Candes.
I also used heavy-tailed (multivariate log-normal) simulation data to 'stress test' the proecedure and assess some of the claims made in
the paper about Normality being unnecessary. Turns out the hand-waving doesn't speed up the asymptotic convergence rate. My report assumes
the reader is familiar with the paper "A knockoff filter for high-dimensional selective inference" https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03574
